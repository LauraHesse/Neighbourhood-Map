# Project Details
Here you'll find my take in using Knockout JS and Google Maps for Udacity Neighbourhood-Map exercise.

# How to use the Map
Simply click on the chosen location or type your search in the search input field. By clicking on the location title, a infoWindow will open, which will display a short description and a picture. 

Enjoy
